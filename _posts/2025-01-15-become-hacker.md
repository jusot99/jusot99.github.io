## Phase 0 — Develop the Hacker Mindset

- **Curiosity over Skill**
  Always ask how and why. Obsess over systems, not just results.

- **Precision over Speed**
  Rushing leads to mistakes. Operate with accuracy and patience.

- **Failure is Part of the Process**
  Getting stuck is normal. Embrace the challenge.

- **Learn Before Automating**
  Don’t rely on tools you don’t understand. Study the logic first.

> Hacking is about thinking. Tools evolve, but mindset endures.

## Phase 1 — Build a Strong Technical Foundation

### 1. Systems Knowledge

- **Linux:** Debian, Arch, file systems, permissions, services, processes
- **Windows:** Registry, services, tokens, users, Active Directory basics
- **Networking:** TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, ARP, ICMP

> Add these to your daily warm-up:
{: .prompt-tip }

```bash
man bash
man 7 signal
curl ifconfig.me
```

---

### 2. Programming Essentials

Choose **two**:

- `Python` – scripting, exploit development
- `Bash` – automation, shell interaction
- `C` – memory corruption, low-level debugging
- `PowerShell` – Windows scripting, post-exploitation

> Knowing **How ?** to script is more valuable than memorizing syntax.

## Phase 2 — Master the Core Tools (Manually)

| Category             | Tools                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Reconnaissance       | `nmap`, `ffuf`, `subfinder`, `crt.sh`, `amass`         |
| Enumeration          | `LinPEAS`, `winPEAS`, `enum4linux`, `BloodHound`       |
| Exploitation         | `Burp Suite`, `sqlmap`, `Metasploit`, `custom scripts`   |
| Privilege Escalation | `GTFOBins`, `LOLBAS`, `Windows Exploit Suggester`      |
| Post-Exploitation    | `socat`, `chisel`, `netcat`, `PowerView`, `Rubeus`     |
| OSINT                | `theHarvester`, `Spiderfoot`, `GHunt`, `twint`         |

## Phase 3 — Train Like a Hacker

### Practice Platforms

- [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com)
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
- [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com)
- [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org)
- [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org)

### Recommended Learning Paths

- OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
- PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester)
- TCM Academy
- PentesterLab
- HackTricks

> Don’t jump from tool to tool. Go deep. Master the process.
{: .prompt-tip }

## Phase 4 — Build Your Arsenal

Structure your GitHub:

- `reverse-shells/`
- `upload-bypasses/`
- `priv-esc-checks/`
- `automation-scripts/`
- `one-liners.txt`
- `writeups/`

> Basic recon automation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
nmap -p- -sC -sV -oA scan $1
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://$1/FUZZ -t 50
```

---

## Phase 5 — Think Like a Hacker

Ask these questions constantly:

- What assumptions is the developer making?
- How is this system trusting input?
- Where does the application fail to validate or sanitize?
- What if I go beyond the intended use?

> *"Real hacking starts in the mind. It’s how you think, not what you copy."*

## Phase 6 — Operate Like a Professional

### Typical Workflow

```text
1. Passive Recon — Subdomains, Git leaks, metadata, email discovery
2. Active Recon — Ports, services, stack fingerprinting
3. Exploitation — CVEs, injection, logic flaws, credential reuse
4. PrivEsc — SUID binaries, misconfigurations, credentials, tokens
5. Post-Ex — Lateral movement, data exfiltration, persistence
6. Reporting — Clean writeups, replayable steps, proof of impact
```

## Phase 7 — Think Long-Term: Strategy & Evolution

Once you’ve got your hands dirty, start looking beyond one-off hacks. Real growth happens when you build systems of knowledge and improvement.

- **Create your own lab:** VirtualBox, VMware, Proxmox, simulated networks
- **Red/Blue Team balance:** Learn both sides to become a better hacker
- **Track your journey:** Use Obsidian, Notion, or a GitHub Wiki
- **Give back:** Blog, build tools, create writeups, teach others

> The more you teach, the more you’ll learn. Share your knowledge to level up faster.
{: .prompt-info }

## Phase 8 — Study These Resources Hard

> Your toolkit isn’t just tools — it’s what you read, who you follow, and how you apply what you learn.

## Daily Habits That Build Real Skill

- [ ] Solve at least one box per week
- [ ] Read one exploit per day
- [ ] Build or update a personal tool
- [ ] Write one method or note in Markdown
- [ ] Share a writeup to reinforce learning

> Document everything. It helps you think clearly and build long-term memory.

## TL;DR — The Hacker's Checklist

- [ ] Master Linux & Bash
- [ ] Learn Python deeply
- [ ] Solve 50+ CTF boxes (HTB, THM, VulnHub)

## Final Thought

Start with your own machine. Break it. Rebuild it. Understand every corner.

## Who Am I?

Hello, I'm Elimane! I am a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast, focused on mastering penetration testing. Currently, I am learning through hands-on challenges on platforms like Hack The Box and diving deep into various aspects of hacking like web exploitation, network exploitation, privilege escalation, and more. I'm constantly improving my skills and sharing tips and resources here for anyone on a similar journey.

### My Mission
I strive to master a broad range of offensive security disciplines from web and network exploitation to embedded systems, wireless environments, and Active Directory infrastructure. I approach every challenge with a mindset rooted in real-world adversary techniques, continuously refining my skills to understand and secure complex systems.
Through this site, I share my knowledge, contribute to the cybersecurity community, and document my growth as a security professional.
I regularly train on platforms like [*Hack The Box*](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1448044), which provide realistic scenarios to sharpen my expertise in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities across diverse environments.

## Hacking Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Web Exploitation
> When testing for vulnerabilities, always use a combination of automated tools (like `nikto` or `gobuster`) and manual techniques to ensure thorough enumeration.

### Tip 2: Privilege Escalation
> If you're stuck on privilege escalation in Linux, always check for world-writable files and directories that may have SUID/SGID set. These are often overlooked but can be critical for privilege escalation.

### Tip 3: Networking
> When conducting network-based exploitation, remember to scan for open ports on both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, as some attackers forget to check the latter.

### Tip 4: Reverse Shells
> Always test reverse shells locally before deploying them. Using a tool like `netcat` or `socat` helps you identify potential issues before the target machine.

### Tip 5: Tools and Resources
> **SecLists** is an excellent resource for wordlists. Always make sure you’re using the most up-to-date wordlists for password spraying, directory brute-forcing, and other enumeration tasks.

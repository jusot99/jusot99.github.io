## Elimane D.

**Offensive Security Specialist**

I focus on hands-on offensive security and practical penetration testing, working in controlled lab environments to understand how systems fail and how to secure them effectively.

My experience covers Linux and Windows systems, web applications, internal networks, and identity-based environments. I regularly practice techniques such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, post-exploitation, and security assessments to simulate real-world threats and improve defensive posture.

I build custom tools and automation in Python, Bash, and PowerShell, and I document everything I learn through labs, writeups, and open-source projects.

Most of my research, tools, and notes are published in [PwnHub](https://github.com/jusot99/pwnhub), my public repository where I share scripts, experiments, and practical security workflows. You can also follow my training and challenge progress on [Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1448044).

Everything here is built for learning, responsible testing, and helping systems become more secure.

## Elimane D.

**Offensive Security Researcher**

I focus on hands-on offensive security research, realistic attack simulations, and building custom tooling. My work is all about understanding how systems fail, chaining weaknesses, and turning technical insights into practical security knowledge.

Most of my research, tools, and notes live in [PwnHub](https://github.com/jusot99/pwnhub), my public offensive security arsenal. I continuously train, experiment, and document my work through labs, tooling, and writeups. You can follow my progress and activity on [Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1448044).
